SERVER/CLIENT Mastermind Game

The idea of the project is to create a game program, in which players compete against each other to guess a secrete code generated by the Server.

There are two entities the Server and the Client. Each has their own commands

SERVER 
	Description
		The server's role is wait for client connection and assign an idNumber to that client. From there the
		server manages the communication between each individual client and the server (ie. Start Game prompt, 
		winners/losers). 

		To provide insight to what is happening in the server, it outputs:
			- Server status
			- Clients Connecting/Disconnecting
			- Outputs the Secret code to the Server terminal for ease of Debugging
			- When the server is processing a client's specific (guess/input)

	Commands
		QUIT - It announces to all players that the server is closing and boots every 
			client off and shutdown the server.

Client
	Description
		The client is the player. The client will get greeted by "user#" followed by their assigned id number.
		The client is prompted if they are ready to start the game, taking a "Y" input from the user to begin.
		Once started the client's goal is be the first to guess secret code generated by server. Once there is 		
		a winner or every client loses (all clients out of guesses), the server will prompt all clients if 		
		they would like to being a new game.

	Commands
		INPUT AT ANY TIME
			SAY <message> - Like a lobby chat, the client can communicate with other clients present in the server
			QUIT - Notifies the server that the client is leaving and ends the connection between the 				
			       server and client
		ONCE GAME STARTS
			HISTORY - Output the client's guess history
		        <user_input> - Client's guess
